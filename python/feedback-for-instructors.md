Thoughts on Humanities Programming
======================

## Good
- decision to begin with command line
- valuable incorporation of git versioning
- repetition and patterning (eg. git-> add, commit, push... sequence)
- balance of presentational information and hands-on exercises
- very good decision to utilize lab laptops preconfigured


## For Reflection
- oscillation between interpreter and coding in IDE. This seemed to cause confusion for some students; possibly it would be better to make a shift towards Atom at a certain point for any extended exercises.
- PPTs are effective for presentation but a text-file or PDF might be helpful for quicker scanning and review. (I like the Markdown/Pandoc workflow so that I can export a slidy and printable, prose pdf.)

## Adjustments
- crucial to see live coding of examples
- useful to see code presented, in powerpoints, as fixed-width text (i.e. Courier)
